## Hello!
{: .post-header}

I'm Ian Clester, a master's student at MIT, and an enthusiast of a whole bunch of things, including (but not limited to!) computer science, electronics, and music.

Here you can find a variety of information I feel like sharing, such as details
about various [personal projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/), my [contact
information]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), and even a few [blog posts]({{
site.baseurl }}/posts/).
