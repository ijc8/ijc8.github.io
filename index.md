## Hello!
{: .post-header}

I'm Ian Clester, a [PhD student](https://music.gatech.edu/phd-music-technology) in [Music Technology](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. Before that, I was a Master's student in [EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT, and before that, an undergrad in EECS and [Music](https://mta.mit.edu/music). Before _that_, I was an enthusiast of a whole bunch of things, including (but not limited to) computer science, electronics, and music. And I still am!

Here you can find information I wish to share, such as details
about [personal projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/), my [contact
information]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), and even a few [blog posts]({{
site.baseurl }}/posts/).
