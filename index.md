## Hello!
{: .post-header}

I'm Ian Clester, a [PhD student](https://music.gatech.edu/phd-music-technology) in [Music Technology](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am advised by [Jason Freeman](https://distributedmusic.gatech.edu/jason/), and my research focuses on **computational music** --- music which is written down as a program rather than a fixed score --- and its implications. This idea is related to [process music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_music), [aleatoric music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music), and [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music). Other interests include HCI and programming languages.

Previously, I was a Master's student in [EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT, an undergrad in EECS and [Music](https://mta.mit.edu/music), and an intern at various places, including [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [Astranis](https://www.astranis.com/). Before all of that, I was an enthusiast of a whole bunch of things, including (but not limited to) computer science, electronics, and music. Fortunately, I still am!

Here you can find information about my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/) and [personal projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/),
plus [contact info]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), and even a few [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/). This site also hosts some of my software, such as [kilobeat]({{ site.baseurl }}/kilobeat/) and [Alternator]({{ site.baseurl }}/alternator/).
