I'm Ian Clester, a senior at MIT, and an enthusiast of a whole bunch of things,
including (but not limited to!) computer science, electronics, mathematics, and
music.

Here you can find a variety of information I feel like sharing, such as details
about various [personal projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/), my [contact
information]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/), and maybe even some [blog posts]({{
site.baseurl }}/posts/) eventually.
