RISC-V is an open instruction set architecture designed to be practical. Basically, it's a cool open standard that also aims for practicality and extensibility.

I'm working with Professor [Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net) and [Thomas
Bourgeat](http://www.csail.mit.edu/user/3875) to develop a formal, friendly, and
runnable RISC-V specification. The idea is to clearly define the correct
behavior from RISC-V in a format that is both human-readable and
machine-readable. At present, this is in the form of an emulator written in
Haskell. This project is available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/mit-plv/riscv-semantics)!
