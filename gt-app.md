Hi! Here are some samples of my work across a few different domains. I realize this is more than the application called for, so feel free to pick one example from each category.

If you're interested, you can read more about some of my compositions on the [projects](/projects) page, and you can hear more on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ijc8). Many of the earlier tracks there were created in the summer of 2018, during which I finished one track a week. Some ([1](https://soundcloud.com/ijc8/caffeine), [2](https://soundcloud.com/ijc8/hello-world)) were created with audio composition languages ([ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) and [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/), respectively).
