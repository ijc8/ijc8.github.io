First, an introduction by Emma:

> He also took like one or two other classes. I’ve completely forgotten what they

> Ian played guitar in the orchestra for MIT Musical Theater Guild’s production of

Thank you, Emma. Indeed, I hardly remember January at this point. Why? Because it's been *six months*. I haven't posted in *over six months*. Wow. In fact, if we look at the time between consecutive posts...

- 1.5 months between posts 0 and 1
- 3 months between posts 1 and 2
- 6 months between posts 2 and 3 (this one)

...the trend is pretty clear, and we should all expect a solid year between this
post and the next one (and at most six more posts in my lifespan, barring
radical advances in life expectancy). This is terrible, and to combat it (and to
boost my average posts/time, which is otherwise abyssmal) I'm going to post in a
burst. Specifically, I'm going to cover:
- Independent Activities Period (January) - that's this post.
- Spring Semester (February - May) - that's the next post.
- Summer Adventures (May - now) - the post after that. May be posted around the start of August, or the start of September, depending on motivation/content.

So, without further adieu, this post. Emma did a fine job summarizing my IAP
(probably better than I would have), so I'll just provide some context, fill in
some details, and post pictures.

Context: MIT has a gap between Fall and Spring semesters. There is, of course,
winter break, which occurs in later December, but there is also a larger space
known as IAP, which ostensibly stands for "Independent Activities Period" but
may also stand for "Infinite Activities Period", "Irrelevant Activities
Prevail", or "I Am Perplexed". (Okay, fine, I made up the last two.)
Basically, you can do whatever you want (as in take an extra four weeks of
break), but there are also a variety of fourish-week classes and activities offered
on and off campus that you can take (or teach!) for fun and/or profit.

As Emma noted, I TA'd a few sessions (specifically, those that didn't conflict
with other obligations) of [6.037](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/), a
wonderful class that keeps alive the dream of using Scheme (now via
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org/)) to teach the fundamentals. I took it myself
as a frosh two winters prior, and it was great to have the chance to help pass
it on.

I also took 6.058, Introduction to Signals and Systems. That class moved pretty
fast, and my attendance wasn't exactly perfect, but I got through the
assignments and even made a neat little final project - huMIDIfier, a tool that
does real-time pitch detection (monophonic, so only one note at a time) and
generates corresponding MIDI events, as a virtual MIDI input. So, you can plug
in your guitar/microphone/electric glockenspiel, fire up huMIDIfier, connect it
to your favorite MIDI-aware software (perhaps a synth, DAW, or [composition
tool](https://musescore.org/en)), and play your heart out. Entry under
"Projects" forthcoming.

Joseph happened. I was kind of terrified due to my lack of competence (both
notationally and mechanically), but it went okay. Luckily, a bunch of my part
("Guitar 2") was playing chords, but for the parts that weren't, I either made a
concentrated effort to get it down, or *ahem* ended up playing chords anyway.
Playing in an orchestra was very cool (the other instrumentalists were typically
awesome, and our conductor was most assuredly awesome), and forced me to suck
less at counting and watching.

The creative radio class was a blast, and it's too bad that we didn't keep doing
stuff with WMBR in the Spring semester. My slightly lame excuse is that we were
both thoroughly hosed, but details will have to wait until the next post.

The essays were varied and interesting (although I associate them more with
Spring than IAP). Any further reflections will also have to wait for another
post though - and I suspect it's more likely to be Emma's post rather than mine.

The Museum of Science is a good example of something I would have totally
forgotten to mention.

Also! I went to a local recording studio a few times throughout IAP, in
preparation for an internship that didn't happen. (I ended up interning at
Google this summer, but again, that's for another post.)

Finally, the last thing you should know about IAP is that it was cold.
