Aha! Proof that this blog didn't die with the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-02-initial-commit %}). Perhaps a slightly larger gap that I had in mind, but not too bad.

Unlike last time, I am in no particular need of activites to kill time (though I
am intermittently waiting on things to compile), so I will probably keep this
post comparatively short, and possibly of the general-life-update variety.

Things are, in short, pretty good.

I declared a minor in music (just before classes began, so as to increase my
odds in case of oversubscription[^1]), and I'm taking three classes in this
area: 21M.301 (Counterpoint and Harmony I), 21M.299 (a seminar which changes
every year; this year, it's on the Beatles), and 21M.401 (Concert Choir). All of
these are pretty enjoyable so far.

I'd like to explain my motivation for taking these (and doing various other
music-related activities), but I think that'll be lengthy and thus best saved
for a future post.

Random Hall's government continues to function, which is good. I presently hold
the positions of Vice President (approx. = Treasurer?), Web Chair, and Soda
(Co-)Chair. I realized I wasn't actually very interested in doing things like
updating the website or writing blog entries[^2], so in my infinite laziness I
started [a wiki](https://random-hall.mit.edu/wiki/) so that other people can add
content. (And also so that more content has a good place to go, to consolidate
scattered information, and various other more legitimate reasons.)

My other classes are going reasonably well. The first 6.046 exam happened, which
I think (?) was okay (I'll find out soon enough, in any case). The exams are
consistently and inscrutably referred to as 'quizzes' by course staff, despite
each being worth 20% of your grade.[^3]

6.175 (Constructive Computer Architecture) is interesting and (like 6.004)
pleasantly hands-on. Also, it is conveniently relevant to my [research]({{
site.baseurl }}/research).

I just finished Hunter Davies' _The Beatles_, which contains a lot of
interesting, often amusing, sometimes insightful information presented in a
charmingly down-to-earth manner. I'm now reading my signed (!!!) copy of
_Turtles All the Way Down_, which I had actually forgotten pre-ordering. As a
friend put it, it's unmistakably John Green, which is fine by me as, long after
high school,[^4] I still haven't quite managed to stop idolizing him.

All in all, things are good, and what's more, things are better than before, and
I think this is in no small part due to a much better attitude and generally
healthier perspective than I had in prior years. For some time now I've been
shedding the parts of me that weren't worth keeping around, including a hoard of
anxieties so heavy that they nearly broke my back. I benefited from this
increasingly throughout last year, and over the summer, but this is the first
year that I've started off in this [new
glow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glow). This all might come off as a bit
dramatic, but I think it's fairly accurate nonetheless.

Anyway, it's about time to cut this post short. Here are some parting pictures,
presented mostly without explanation:

[^1]: I fell victim to oversubscription when I tried to get into 21M.301 last semester, and I was very tilted.
[^2]: I realize there is some irony here. Maybe I will write an entry for Random's blog.
[^3]: Note that the final, worth 30%, is in fact referred to as a 'Final Exam', _not_ a 'Final Quiz'.
[^4]: I forgot what I was going to put here. Oh well. John and Hank are pretty cool; DFTBA.
